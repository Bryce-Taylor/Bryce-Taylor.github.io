## Description and Motivation

This Unit Project is going to be my very own website like it's going to describe who I am. It's going to talk about
a small portfolio of me and in that small portfolio will be in a box. I have a welcome title for whoever visits my 
website and I will have a professional picture of me. Then under my picture, it will have My full name in bold text
and under my name, it's going to have my contact info. It will also have skills which means my skills/experience. 
Then under all of that, it will have a section showing the projects that I did throughout Base Camp Coding Academy.
They will be in a box and spaces out individually. In each box will have one picture of my project and under the 
picture will have a text which is the title of that project and it will have what language. I will also add a Nav
Bar to keep things organize. 

### Here's a drawing of what it's suppose to look like:

## Prior Art

I liked John Terenzio and Cole Anderson Websites they had the same idea for their website but both had a completely different
look on their website. Like Cole and John, both had their information about themselves short and sweet which I like because that
is something that I am going to do with my website just making my information short and sweet. The reason why is because
putting too much information about yourself will probably bore the user, so I will make sure to add the most important
information about myself instead of rambling about my life. I did like how both had their information separate to a different 
part of their website but I want to have my website where it has all of the information on one page and organizes it to my Navbar.

## Core User Workflows

- Information about Me: I want to have my information about me very organize where the NavBar will help the user guiding
them to a certain part of the website about me. I also don't want it very confusing looking on my website I want it to
look professional and clean looking.
- NavBar: The NavBar need to be working on this website because it will help guide the user of what part of the information they
want about me. 
- Colors: I need to make sure that I pick the right colors for my website because it will help to make it look better and
professional.
- My work: Once the user is looking at my work I like to make a box that has a small description of that project show
when they click it they should have already what the idea is about.

## Daily Goals
### Tuesday: The User should see what the website should look like
On Tuesday my website should look like what I have drawn about my website until the end of the day. That they can
see all the information and My Projects on the website.
### Wednesday: The User should be able to look at the website on their phone
On Wednesday my website should be able to pull on the user phone. Like you can look at it in different sizes on my website.

### Thursday: Checking to see if everything is working and Finishing up
On Thursday I will make sure that my website should be working and also be finishing up my website. If there was
anything left on my website that I need to finish on my website.
